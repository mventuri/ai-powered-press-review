# Financial Press Review Generator

This project is a Python script that generates comprehensive financial press reviews by retrieving key news from an API and analyzing them using a large language model (LLM). The script is designed to act as a senior financial journalist, focusing on the impact of news on financial markets, specific industries, and relevant companies.

- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses the Anthropic Claude-3.5 model to analyze the news and generate a structured press review.
- **Error Handling**: Includes robust error handling and logging to manage API failures and other unexpected issues.
- **Automated Report Generation**: Appends the generated press reviews to a text file for easy reference.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
